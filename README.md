# Digital.NSW Tech Interview Test

This code was provided and utilised for a tech interview test with Digital NSW team. The app is in ReactsAdditional stylings have been added for a presentation purpose.

## Brief & MVP

As part of the first challenge, when the button is clicked display Good morning message at the bottom of button and change the button label to Hide greeting.
When the user enters name in the input field, the message should say Good morning with name.

Details:

- Show Good morning message only on button click.
- Change the button label to Hide greeting
- When Hide greeting button is clicked, hide Good morning message
- Welcome alert should be not be shown when the button is clicked.
- User should be able to enter the name in the input box
- Once the name is entered and clicked on submit, show good morning message with name.
- Show the number of times greeting button was clicked in the counter input box

## Implementation

- Declaring correct types for the event types was one of the challenging aspects in this test. Handling states and updating values were straightforward.

## Reflection

- I need to train up my TypeScript skills and write more codes with TypeScript to practice and be exposed to the various situations/types.
